# Tailwind CSS Webpack 4 Starter Project

This is an example of a Webpack 4 setup for using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This is also my attempt to further my understanding of Webpack 4.

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn
```

To build for development

```bash
npm build:dev
```

To build for production

```bash
npm build
```

To watch for changes

```bash
npm run start
```

## TODO

- Add documentation for yarn
- Figure out what the other important webpack commands are
